<h1>Zymer</h1>

<p><em>An Interactive Console-Based Adventure Inspired by the Timeless Spirit of Zork.</em></p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p><em>Immerse yourself in an interactive console-based experience inspired by the classic adventure of <strong>Zork</strong>—where each choice rewires the molecular structure of reality.</em> Enter the world of <strong>Zymer</strong>, a place where the boundaries of existence are not only flexible but malleable, transformed at the molecular level through bioactive enzymes. Here, every decision you make initiates a cascade of molecular reactions, catalyzing strange and often irreversible transformations.</p>

<p>In <strong>Zymer</strong>, the player is more than an explorer; they are a molecular architect, capable of altering an unstable world with each action. Will you catalyze new reactions, mutate environments, or destabilize the very fabric of this world? Every command is an experiment, and every path unveils new, astonishing, and unsettling reactions that can shift the course of the game's reality.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Molecular-Level Transformations:</strong> Use bioactive enzymes to alter the world around you in ways both subtle and profound. Watch as each choice ripples outward, affecting everything you encounter.</li>
  <li><strong>Experimental Gameplay:</strong> Every command is a new experiment, yielding unpredictable and fascinating results. Your actions will accumulate, leading to either progressive synthesis or chaotic entropy.</li>
  <li><strong>Immersive Atmosphere:</strong> Inspired by the suspenseful ambiance of <em>Bioshock</em> and the exploratory wonder of <em>Zork</em>, <strong>Zymer</strong> is designed to pull you into a world where the unknown lurks in every corner.</li>
  <li><strong>Branching Paths and Outcomes:</strong> Your choices lead to multiple potential endings, with the state of the world evolving based on your decisions. In <em>Zymer</em>, the smallest molecular change can mean the difference between survival and oblivion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p>In <strong>Zymer</strong>, your journey begins with an enigmatic command prompt. From here, you’ll navigate through a world whose state is constantly shifting on a molecular level. The world itself is volatile, held together only by the balance of its enzymes, which you will harness, manipulate, or potentially destabilize as you proceed.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Explore:</strong> Traverse an expansive, text-based environment, uncovering mysteries and encountering unique challenges.</li>
  <li><strong>Catalyze:</strong> Use bioactive enzymes to transform the molecular structure of objects, creatures, and the environment itself.</li>
  <li><strong>Adapt:</strong> Respond to unexpected reactions and environmental changes as the results of your actions unfold in real-time.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Inspirations</h2>

<p><em>Zymer</em> draws from the immersive, atmospheric storytelling of <em>Bioshock</em> and the pioneering text-based interactions of <em>Zork</em>. Each encounter is designed to provoke curiosity, test wits, and invite exploration, blending classic text-based adventure mechanics with a scientifically rich, reactive world.</p>
